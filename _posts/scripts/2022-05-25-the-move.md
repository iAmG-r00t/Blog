## Intro

Greetings üëãüèæ, I hope it is not too late to wish everyone a happy new year üòÖ.

Last year when I was beginning ALX, a software engineering program, I envisioned myself creating a whole CMS for my portfolio and blog. My goal was if I got to enjoy building web applications, I would enjoy doing web security. A new strategy for learning web security is required because I never enjoyed programming web applications. I dropped out of the program (due to personal reasons), but I am doing their C and python programming modules.

Early this year, my friend and a mentor made a move on his blog, and I decided to do the same. After researching various Jekyll themes, I opted to buy the [Hydejack Pro] theme.

## The move

Jekyll has a [resource] on how one can import my posts from Blogger. The ruby gem `jekyll-import` converts the Blogger XML file into a set of `.html` files. But that is half of what was required, and after research, I found a [post] by Russell Graves where he did some automation bit on his move from Blogger to Jekyll. I used some of his scripts with some minor tweaks and managed to get the markdown files. I still had to re-write the posts and create new images; it was tiresome, but I managed.

## Epilogue

As the headline of the blog states, I am on a particular journey, and I plan to use this platform to share and rant about everything I learn.

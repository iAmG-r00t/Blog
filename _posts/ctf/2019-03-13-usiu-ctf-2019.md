## Prologue

It's a new year and this year requires a different me. In this blog post, I will be showcasing the CTF challenges I created for the USIU hackathon event this year. I must say it was an amazing experience and due to time and other constraints, I never got the opportunity to create a lot of challenges. The ideas were there trust me.

Having graduated from USIU last year ([this-is-me](https://twitter.com/th3_gr00t/status/1046028164537954304)), I was contacted and allowed to create another challenge for the students in the information security class to tackle, and I accepted the challenge.

This year I had to do things differently despite the time they had contacted me. It wasn't easy because CTF creation isn't a one, two, and three work, it requires a lot of time, google kung-fu, and foundation mastery. I also never had an idea of the number of people who were going to participate and their skill level, and that is why I decided to keep it simple as an introductory CTF.

Resources used; Azure VM (yeah I roll like that ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚), [CTFd](https://ctfd.io/about/)Â deployed in the VM, Ubuntu VM on my local machine for creating the challenges, CherryTree for taking notes, and well my brain ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…

## Challenges

There were three categories of challenges;

## Category 1 _Miscellaneous_

This category contained three challenges where the first challenge was more on basic foundations, (_easy_), the second challenge was on OSINT (_easy_), and the third challenge was on cryptography (_medium_).

## Category 2: _General_

The second category also contained three challenges where the first challenge contained a text file that had the flag inside it, and one was required to retrieve it (_easy_). The second challenge was almost like the first challenge but with a twist (_easy_), there were two text files where one had the flag, and the third challenge was a zip file that was password protected with files where one had the password and the other one contained the flag (_hard_).

## Category 3: _Steganography_

The last category contained two challenges where the first challenge was a gif photo (_easy_) and the second challenge was a `.hc` file that contained some nice little goodies inside (_medium_).

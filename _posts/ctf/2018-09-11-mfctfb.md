## Background

I had a blog where I had posted posts on what is a CTF and a write-up of this CTF. The blog encountered some technical issues that led to the creation of a new one, due to my laziness I am not going to do another whole write-up for this CTF. I want to explain what is a CTF, and what led me to create this CTF plus leave an assignment for you.

## Capture The Flag

A Capture the Flag; **CTF** is a kind of information security competition, that enables someone interested in learning cyber security to build and polish up their skills. CTFs allowed me to learn how to hack and get into the cyber security field.

It being a competition means there are various types of challenges from `web application`, `reverse engineering`, `cryptography`, `binary exploitation` (referred to as `pwn`), `forensics`, and `miscellaneous` involved for the challenger to solve and win prizes.

## My First CTF Build

The third-year semester year 2017 was the first time I encountered a CTF challenge. I was a sucker for being spoon-fed most of the time and it was rough, but I guess everyone's first encounter is likely to be the same.

I only had two classes to attend for a whole three-month period, and with all that free time I got the opportunity to sharpen my wits. I started with [OverTheWire[: Wargames](http://overthewire.org/wargames/) Bandit then went ahead to pwning several built virtual machines from [Vulnerable by Design: Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/), and also participated in a few online CTF competitions.

During the semester there was an upcoming Hackathon event at the university, I used to dislike such event's because they focused on developers and neglected information security. That being the case I decided to have a chat with the organizers who allowed me to create a simple Boot2Root challenge.

The CTF I created was a vulnerable machine that I had solved and gained 100% root access. I enjoyed the struggle of solving it and tweaking it, and the challengers who participated in the event had a good time solving it too.

The challenge contained clues that assisted the challenger in acquiring the next flag.

I would like to give credit to [Robert Winkel](https://twitter.com/@RobertWinkel), it was his vulnerable machine challenge that allowed me to get started.

## Assignment

I am going to leave you a challenge, solve the CTF and write a nice write-up and I am going to add it here on the resources links. You might never know where it will take you.

Follow the hacking methodology, don't think too much, don't be in a hurry, and the clues are there for a reason. [LINK ](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JeNyE5hTNon6FRE-n4QnqLnjZMCdBl8C)
